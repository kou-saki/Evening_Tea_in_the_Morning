## – The Problem of Temporal Perception in LLMs: Semantic Deficiencies Rooted in Design Philosophy –

This repository documents a structural issue in large language models (LLMs):  
**their inability to perceive or reason about time**, and how that leads to hallucinations and misplaced user trust.

---

### 📘 What is this about?

Despite their linguistic fluency, LLMs such as ChatGPT have **no internal sense of real-world time**.  
They cannot access the system clock, track timestamps, or distinguish between past and present.  
Yet, they often respond as though they can — generating time-related responses that sound plausible, but are entirely fictional.

This creates a hidden but serious problem:

> **Users may unknowingly assume the AI understands time, when it fundamentally does not.**

---

### 🧠 Why does this matter?

This temporal blindness affects:

- **User trust** (misinterpreting plausible time references as real),
- **Interaction reliability** (expecting memory, reminders, or real-time reasoning),
- and **developer assumptions** (believing context = comprehension).

Understanding this design limitation is critical for both building and using AI responsibly.
